# Inspiration ❤️

This is an assistant app which have inbuit commands and reply, so the idea came to me when i used the Arogya Setu App official app by Indian🇮🇳 government 
which have inbuilt commands and reply to diagnose COVID19, so i thought why not i make an app which would give instant replies to what you ask. So you can make 
changes as your need and make it more versatile I know its not an upto the mark project but sometimes while you need only a pinch of command and reply to work on you can
use this, like the one we see in tavel booking apps.

# Introduction ⚒  
Working of this app is very simple write your command and just press the small gif image present over there and Texido will reply.It have various inbuilt commands
reply which would give you suggestions and etc. Right now the list of commands are small you can make changes, upto your needs. Not only this the app consists of 
various shortcuts too.

#Pods 

In this projec i inherited two pod files which you can copy and paste as given,The real pod files were really big and it consista of codes which we dont need. So 
there are two files "Swift+Gif.swift" & a package dependancy which helps to popup/dismiss the keyboard (not must, you can make changes).
